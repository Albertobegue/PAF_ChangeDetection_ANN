# Study of LSTM

## Questions
. what is batch_size, epoch, unites size
  
. how do we set and learn the input/out data dimensions

. what do the different layers mean appart from LSTM, say, Dense, Timedistributed, etc.

. what is an activation function, how to choose

 Default: hyperbolic tangent (tanh). If you pass None, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: a(x) = x).
 We got a significant boost in performance just by using activation function.
 Positive properties like nonlinearity, differentiability, large value of derivative.
 It is important to note that there’s no best activation function. One may be better than other in many cases, but will be worse in some other cases.
 Another important note is that using different activations function doesn’t affect what our network can learn, only how fast (how many data/epochs it needs).
